<!--EVENTS - Events in JavaScript are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser or within the document. 
    They can be triggered by user interactions like clicking or typing, browser actions like page loading, or by JavaScript code itself.-->

        // As we know javascript is a sequential running language. Every sequence is run after another sequence.

    //some events happen on the browser which are evoked after any kind of activity.

    //These activity is known as the events.

    //The activity can be of many types as mouse hovering, mouse clicked, double clicked, keyboard's value clicked, drag and drop, etc.
   
    //1st approach

     //Writing onclick="" in an html tag itself  for a click event may not be a very good approach when the scale is large.
    // <li><img width="300" id="Gatewayofindia" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.LdC9HIpGoh8EnUh0jjdSzgHaE2?w=269&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7" alt="" onclick="alert('Gatewayofindia')"> </li>
    
     //it is not recommended

     //2nd approach

    //document.getElementById('Indiagate').onclick= function(){
   // alert('Indiagate clicked')
  // This approach can also be accepted but the event listener features not only provides the click events but also different events.
 
//3rd and best approach
  // and with event listener () we give the type of event and another parameter as false which is by default.

document.getElementById('Indiagate').addEventListener('click', function(e){
   //alert('Indiagate clicked again ')
   console.log(e);
   


         //+++++++++++++++++ EVENT OBJECTS++++++++++++++++++++++//

 //some topics-
 // type, timestamp, defaultPrevented, target, toElement , srcElement, currentTarget , clientX, clientY, screenX , ScreenY 
        
        //e.type 
        console.log(e.type);//click
        //it returns the type of event

        //e.timestamp
        console.log(e.timeStamp);//4159
        //The timeStamp event property returns the number of milliseconds from the document was finished loading until the specific event was created.
    //Not all systems provide this information, therefore, timeStamp may be not available for all systems/events.

    //defaultprevented

     // The defaultPrevented event property checks whether the preventDefault() method was called for the event.
    // as we know the preventDefault() method holds the value 

    //target
    console.log(e.target);//<img id="Indiagate" width="300" src="https://th.bing.com/th/iâ€¦&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7"
    //The target property returns the element where the event occured.

    //e.toElement
    console.log(e.toElement);
 // It's a property of the event object (e) that retrieves a reference to the element that the mouse pointer entered during specific mouse events.


 //e.cuurentTarget

console.log(e.currentTarget);
//// the currentTarget property returns the element whose event listener triggered the event.
    
//e.clientX

console.log(e.clientX);
//The clientX property returns the horizontal client coordinate of the mouse pointer when a mouse event occurs.
//The clientX property is read-only.
//The client area is the current window.

//clientY
console.log(e.clientY);
//The clientY property returns the vertical client coordinate of the mouse pointer when a mouse event occurs.
//The clientY property is read-only.
//The client area is the current window.


//screenX
 console.log(e.screenX);

 //The screenX property returns the horizontal screen coordinate of the mouse pointer when a mouse event is triggered.

 //screenY
 console.log(e.screenY);
 //The screenY property returns the vertical screen coordinate of the mouse pointer when a mouse event occurs.


 // ..... ...........       Event propagation
//... default value is always false

 //event propagation is managed through a mechanism called the Event Model, which encompasses two main phases: capturing and bubbling.

//1.Event bubbling- (BUTTOM TO TOP)
)
//In this method, the event starts at the target element and bubbles up through its ancestors. This is the default behavior for most events in browsers.
// bubbles event property returns true if an event is a bubbling event.

//Otherwise it returns false.

//example =

//document.getElementById("image").addEventListener('click',function(e){
   // console.log("clicked inside  the ul");//clicked inside  the ul
//},false)//it will print when we click inside the image i.e ul


//document.getElementById("Indiagate").addEventListener('click',function(e){
   // console.log("Indiagate clicked"); //it will print when we wiil click owl
    //Indiagate clicked-1st
    //clicked inside  the ul-2nd
//},false)

// As we know the "images" id is the parent of the "owl" id.
    //If we click on the owl image (with the false parameter or no parameter), first it targets the child then the parent.
    // It travels bottom to top in dom tree
    // It is called as event bubbling.
    

///  Event capturing- (TOP TO BUTTOM)
// In this method, the event starts at the outermost parent element and captures down to the target element before bubbling back up.

// It first captures  the outermost element and propagates to the inner elements.
    // It travels from top to bottom or from parents to children.
    // with the true parameter mentioned

    //example=

    document.getElementById("image").addEventListener('click',function(e){
    console.log("clicked inside  the ul");//clicked inside  the ul
},true)

document.getElementById("Indiagate").addEventListener('click',function(e){
    console.log("Indiagate clicked"); //it will print when we wiil click owl
    
    //clicked inside  the ul -1st
    //Indiagate clicked -2nd

},true)
